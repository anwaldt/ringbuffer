This site features online materials accompanying the seminar `Network Systems for Music Interaction <https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/sommersemester_2021/network_systems_for_music_interaction/>`_ (NSMI) at TU Berlin. In the NSMI class we will jointly work with the SPRAWL System for local and global audio and control networks. This includes technical aspects, such as basics of professional Linux audio systems, transmission protocols and programming, as well as the use of the system for compositions and improvisations with the whole team.
